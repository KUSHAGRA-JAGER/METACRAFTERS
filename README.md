# Project Title MyToken Contract

## Description
This is a simple ERC-20 token contract written in Solidity. It allows users to mint and burn tokens, and keeps track of the total supply and individual balances.

## Getting Started
To use this contract, you'll need to have a basic understanding of Solidity and the Ethereum blockchain.

## Installing
This contract is written in Solidity, so you'll need to have a Solidity compiler installed on your machine. You can use Remix, a popular online Solidity IDE, or install a local compiler like solc.

## Executing program
To execute this contract, you'll need to deploy it to a blockchain network like Ethereum or a testnet like Ropsten. You can use a tool like Truffle or Remix to deploy and interact with the contract.
